# Figma → React

Rules for turning a Figma design into React code. This skill is deliberately stack-agnostic: detect
the target project's real conventions first, then follow them — never impose a styling system,
resolution, or constraint the project doesn't already have. The one exception is **component
structure**: when the project has no real components to conform to, follow the Figma component
hierarchy instead of collapsing the design into one file — see "Component structure & granularity"
in section 1.

## 0. Preflight the Figma file first (prevent, don't compensate)

Many §7 pixel-fidelity gotchas are not code-reading failures — they are **Figma hygiene problems**
this pipeline is being asked to paper over (unbound colors, a collapsed surface-elevation ladder, a
substituted brand font, off-ramp type, unpinned theme modes). Fixing the **source node** is strictly
better than compensating downstream, because the compensation re-breaks every time the design is
regenerated.

Before codegen, run the [`figma-preflight`](../figma-preflight/SKILL.md) skill on the target node(s).
It detects the source-fixable subset of §7 and either **reports** it (a checklist to verify/request
from the designer — the safe default when you don't own the file) or **fixes** it in Figma (when the
user owns/co-owns the file). Each source-fixable §7 bullet below is tagged **[preflight]** and points
back here. The remaining §7 items are inherent to codegen or delivery — handle those during and after
implementation as usual. If preflight isn't run (out of remit, non-interactive), continue with §7 as
the downstream fallback and note it in the summary.

When a design node is **updated** and you re-implement against it, re-check the preflight findings you
previously compensated for. Designers fix these: a scaled component instance gets rebuilt at its
native size, an unbound literal gets bound, a substituted font gets replaced. Every workaround you
left in code for a source problem becomes a *new* defect the moment the source is fixed, so treat
"which of my compensations are now unnecessary?" as part of re-implementing, and delete the ones the
file no longer needs.

## 0.5 Relationship to the Figma plugin's `figma-design-to-code`

The Figma plugin ships a `figma-design-to-code` skill that owns the **tool contract**: how to call
`get_design_context`, what its response hints mean, and how its assets behave. That is Figma's to
maintain and tracks their MCP API — this skill deliberately does not duplicate it.

**Load it first, then layer this skill on top.** This skill wins wherever they disagree (project
conventions, styling system, component structure, anything `AGENTS.md` says). They do not otherwise
conflict — every overlap is this skill stating the same rule more strictly.

Carry these over from it; they are not restated below:

- **Apply the response hints by priority**, earlier overriding later: Code Connect snippets (use the
  mapped codebase component directly) → component documentation links → design annotations → design
  tokens → raw hex / absolute positioning. A file with Code Connect mappings has already answered
  §3's "search the project for an existing component to reuse" — check the hints before searching.
- **Asset URLs expire in ~7 days.** The `https://.../api/mcp/asset/...` URL renders immediately but
  404s later. For code you commit, download and commit the exact asset bytes, or wire the image to
  the project's data source. Never commit the MCP URL itself.
- **Reuse a project icon only if its glyph clearly matches** — a name match is not enough.
- **Size icons explicitly:** a fixed-size container with both width and height set, and the leaf
  `<img>` sized to fill it (`100%` or fixed px) — never `auto`, which blows the image up to its
  intrinsic size.
- **Error recovery:** read a `get_design_context` error before retrying; a file-only URL with no
  `node-id` means asking the user for a node-specific URL, never guessing; on timeout retry against
  a smaller node; never silently fall back to hand-writing the screen from the screenshot alone.

## 1. Learn the project before touching Figma

- Read `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` at the project root if present. Anything they say **overrides this
  skill** on conflict (e.g. "no hover states", a fixed canvas size, accessibility requirements,
  dependency-placement rules).
- Identify the styling approach already used by existing components (CSS Modules, Tailwind,
  styled-components or other CSS-in-JS, Sass, plain CSS, vanilla-extract, etc.) and use that same
  approach for new code. Do not introduce a second styling system alongside an established one.
- Check whether existing screens are fixed-size or responsive. If components hardcode pixel values
  with no media queries or breakpoints, treat the target as fixed-size and use the exact Figma px
  values without inventing responsiveness. If the project already uses fluid units, breakpoints, or
  `%`/`vw`/`clamp()`, build the new UI responsively too, matching the existing breakpoints. Never
  assume a specific resolution — if it's ambiguous and matters, ask.
- Locate where design tokens live (CSS custom properties, a theme object, a Tailwind config, a
  design-system package) and where shared/reusable components live (commonly `src/components/`,
  `components/`, or a UI package). Both should be reused, not duplicated.
- Check `package.json` for the project's actual dev/build/lint scripts and package manager instead
  of assuming `npm run dev` — a project-specific `/run` skill, if installed, can also launch it.
- Match how the project already treats hover/focus/active states (some touchscreen-only or kiosk
  apps intentionally omit them) and accessibility attributes — don't add or remove either category
  based on assumption; follow what's already there or what `AGENTS.md` says.
- Keep new dependencies in whatever section (`dependencies` vs `devDependencies`) the project's
  existing packages use for comparable tools — some deployment setups (e.g. buildpack-based hosts)
  require everything in `dependencies`.

### Component structure & granularity (decide before implementing)

Figma designs are built from components and instances (e.g. a `MetricCard`, a `Tag`, a `Panel`, a
table row). The **default target is one code component per meaningful Figma component/node**, composed
to mirror the design's hierarchy — not a single monolithic component for the whole screen. Which
structure you actually use depends on what already exists in the repo:

- **Empty or near-empty project** — no real UI components yet, or only starter/demo scaffolding (e.g.
  a Vite counter `App.jsx`, a single stylesheet, no component directory or shared components): **use
  the Figma structure.** Create a component for each meaningful Figma component/node and compose them,
  establishing the hierarchy and naming from the design. Do **not** collapse the whole screen into one
  monolithic component just because the starter happened to be a single file — a bare starter is not a
  convention to preserve.

- **Project already contains several real components** — an established component architecture,
  styling system, and/or token layer: do **not** silently impose the Figma structure, and do **not**
  silently flatten the design to fit. **Ask the user explicitly** (e.g. via `AskUserQuestion`,
  ideally together with the section 2 question) which they want:
  1. **Keep the existing structure** — generate the new screen within the current architecture and
     conventions, reusing existing components and tokens (the behaviour described in section 4).
  2. **Refactor to the Figma structure** — reorganize/rewrite so the code matches the Figma component
     hierarchy and naming (one component per Figma node), migrating existing code as needed.

  Proceed only according to the user's choice; if the run is non-interactive and the user can't be
  asked, keep the existing structure and note the assumption in the final summary.

When you do create per-node components, mirror the Figma component **names** and nesting, and — if
`figma-sync` is opted in (section 2) — add a `// figma-sync:` annotation per component so the
node→component mapping is explicit.

### Implement it, or just export it? (ask)

Before implementing a node, ask what in it is actually dynamic. If you can find nothing — no live
values, no state, no interaction, nothing the app's data layer feeds — then **offer a PNG export of
the node as an alternative to implementing it**, and let the user choose. An export is often more
faithful than code (nothing to reconstruct) and a fraction of the work; it only costs the ability to
change the content at runtime. Ask this together with the section 2 question.

Applies at any granularity — a whole screen, a panel, a decorative layer. In a non-interactive run,
implement as usual and note that an export was the cheaper option.

## 2. Optional companion skills — ask the user first

Three companion skills can extend this workflow. All three are **optional**: none of them is
required to translate a design, and none may be used without the user's consent. After learning
the project (section 1) and **before implementing**, check which of them are relevant to this
project, then ask the user **once, in a single question** (multi-select, e.g. via
`AskUserQuestion`) which ones to use for this task — together with the section 1 questions
(component structure, implement vs. export), so the user is asked once. Skip any the user
declines and don't ask again in the same session. In a non-interactive run where the user cannot be asked, skip all
three and note that in the final summary.

- **`figma-sync`** — keeps generated components verifiably in sync with their Figma nodes.
  Relevant when the project has a `.figma-sync/` directory, an `@artcom/figma-sync` dependency,
  or `figma:*` scripts in `package.json`. If the user opts in: keep existing
  `// figma-sync: file=<fileKey> node=<nodeId> name=<ComponentName>` annotations intact, add one
  to each newly implemented component, and after implementation re-baseline with the project's
  update-manifest script (e.g. `npm run figma:update-manifest`), confirming the status script
  (e.g. `npm run figma:status`) reports `[SYNC]` for the touched components.

- **`react-pixel-overlay`** — a PerfectPixel-style overlay for pixel-perfect QA. Relevant when
  the project depends on `react-pixel-overlay` / `@artcom/react-pixel-overlay` (or mounts a
  `PixelOverlay` component). If the user opts in: export the implemented Figma frame as a PNG at
  the exact target resolution into the project's overlay sources folder (commonly
  `public/design-overlays/`), then verify the running app under the overlay — difference blend
  mode makes any deviation light up — as part of the Verification step.

- **`config-content-assets`** — the project's convention for separating configuration, content,
  and assets from component code. If the user opts in and the skill is installed, invoke it and
  follow its instructions for where downloaded Figma assets, copy/text content, and configurable
  values belong instead of hardcoding them into components.

If a skill the user chose turns out not to be available in this project, say so, continue
without it, and mention the gap in the final summary.

## 3. Required flow (do not skip)

1. **Get the design context** for the exact node(s): call the Figma MCP tool that returns the
   structured node representation (`get_design_context`; some connectors name it `get_code`).
2. If the response is truncated or too large, call **`get_metadata`** for the node map, then
   re-fetch only the needed child node(s) with `get_design_context`.
   - **A child fetch does not describe its container.** `get_design_context` returns the styling of
     the node you asked for; the fill, padding, gap and radius of every frame *above* it are simply
     absent. Fetching sub-frames to save context therefore turns each wrapper into a guess — and the
     wrapper is usually what carries the surface colour. If you drill into children, fetch the
     container node too (or the whole card once, with `forceCode` if it is only borderline large).
     `get_metadata` gives you a child's x/y/size, which makes a wrapper's *padding* look inferable;
     it tells you nothing about its **fill**, so never conclude a container is white from geometry.
3. Call **`get_screenshot`** (aka `get_image`) for a visual reference of the exact variant.
4. Pull Figma variables with **`get_variable_defs`** if available, and map them to the project's
   existing design tokens (see Tokens below).
5. If the target spans multiple linked frames (a flow, not a single screen), pull each frame's
   click wiring via the Figma REST API's `interactions` field before implementing — see
   "Prototype interactions" below. Do this before writing navigation/state code, not after.
6. **Search the project's component directory for an existing component to reuse** before writing
   anything new. Reuse is mandatory — only create a new component if nothing fits.
7. Only after you have context + screenshot + reuse decision (+ interaction map, if step 5
   applied): download any needed assets, then implement — applying whichever companion skills the
   user opted into (section 2).
8. **Verify 1:1** against the screenshot (see Verification) before marking the task complete.

## 4. Implementation rules

- Treat MCP output as a _representation_ of design and behavior, not as final code. Rewrite it into
  the project's own idioms (its component style, file layout, and styling approach).
- Map Figma **Auto Layout** directly to `display: flex` / `display: grid` (or the equivalent utility
  classes) with the exact gaps, padding, and sizes from the node data — do not approximate spacing.
- **A frame's height is not its text's line-height.** Text/label frames often reserve extra vertical
  space (fixed frame height, or padding around the line box) beyond the glyphs. Porting only
  `font-size` + `line-height` makes the element shorter than the design; when it sits above other
  content, everything below shifts up. Carry the layer's **explicit frame height** (or its padding),
  not just the type ramp — e.g. a 64px heading frame around a 60px line, or a 48px label whose text
  line box is only ~36px.
- **Give fixed-size children `flex-shrink: 0` inside an overflowing flex container.** Figma frames that
  overflow are *clipped* (overflow-clip), not shrunk. A CSS flex container whose content overflows will
  instead shrink its children by default, silently undoing an explicit `height`/`width` you just set.
  Mark fixed-dimension children `flex-shrink: 0` so they keep their design size and the container clips,
  matching Figma.
- Reuse tokens, existing components, and typography wherever possible. Match the surrounding code's
  naming and structure.
- Respect existing routing, state, and data-fetch patterns already in the repo.
- When Figma and an existing token conflict, prefer the token and adjust spacing/size minimally to
  match, rather than hardcoding the Figma value.

### Components

- **First settle structure via the section 1 decision** ("Component structure & granularity"): in an
  empty/near-empty project, or when the user chose to refactor, create one component per meaningful
  Figma node mirroring the design hierarchy; otherwise generate within the existing structure as below.
- New UI components go wherever the project already keeps them, following its existing naming and
  file-organization convention (co-located styles, index files, folder-per-component, etc.) — mirror
  an existing component's layout exactly.
- If a component needs a new variant, **extend the existing component**, don't clone it.
- **Reusing a component for a second screen: reuse the code, re-derive the data.** When a new frame
  is "the same layout with different content", the temptation is to copy the sibling screen's content
  entry and edit the visible strings. That silently carries over every **state-bearing** value the
  strings don't show — which step of a progress timeline is `current`, which list rows are warning vs
  success, which item is emphasised, which tag tone applies. Read those from the new node's
  `get_design_context` like any other property. A copied timeline whose "in progress" marker sits one
  step off looks plausible in isolation and is only obvious next to the export.
- **Two instances of one Figma component can differ — put the difference in data, not in the shared
  component.** Designers override colour, padding, or a field per instance, so "the same card" on a
  second screen may set its title in `text/primary` where the first uses `text/secondary`, or add a
  16px inset the first doesn't have. Diff the **new instance's** design context against what your
  component already does. When they disagree, resist "fixing" the shared component globally: that
  silently breaks the screen you already verified. Drive the difference from the same data layer the
  content comes from, defaulting to the behaviour already verified. If a single component accumulates
  several such flags, say so in the summary — it is usually design drift the designer should confirm,
  not intent.
- **A screen's states are separate frames and disagree like separate instances do.** Before/after an
  interaction — a plan accepted, a row expanded — is its own frame, and designers update one and not
  the other. Check the state frames against each other, not just each against your render: wording
  that changes when nothing in the data changed, or a layout that only differs by state, is nearly
  always an un-swept frame rather than intent. Follow each frame for its own state and list the
  disagreements in the summary. A fix derived from one state frame can regress another — see "After
  changing a shared component" in [`figma-measure`](../figma-measure/SKILL.md).
- **One data field driving two visuals will eventually be asked to split.** This is Figma's
  per-frame divergence reaching your data model: a `tone` that colours both a marker and a status dot
  is fine until one frame recolours the marker alone. When that happens, add the narrower control
  (`badgeTone: "neutral"`) rather than changing the shared field — flipping `tone` fixes the marker
  and silently recolours the dot, which nobody asked for and no screen-wide metric will show you
  (`figma-measure` §3 is how you'd catch it).
- Import and apply styles the way the rest of the project does (e.g. `styles.foo` for CSS Modules,
  `className="..."` for Tailwind, a styled-component call, etc.).

### Tokens

- Use the project's existing token/variable references — never hardcode a raw hex/rgb/px value that
  a token already covers.
- If the Figma design uses a variable **not yet** defined in the project: add it wherever tokens
  already live, using the **Figma variable's own name** (adapted to the project's existing naming
  convention), then reference it. Do **not** invent extra component-level alias layers that the
  design doesn't define.
- Match the project's existing font-loading approach (`@font-face`, a font package, a web-font link,
  etc.) for any typeface Figma specifies. **Don't assume the design font is missing/substituted** —
  it may already be installed at the OS level (so the browser renders it directly from a family-name
  reference with no `@font-face`) or bundled. Verify before concluding the *family* is wrong:
  **horizontal** metrics (wrapping, clipping, ellipsis) usually diverge because of a CSS property, not
  the typeface. **Vertical** offsets are the opposite case — there the font files are the first thing
  to check, not the CSS; see the next bullet. If the font is only OS-installed and the app must render
  identically elsewhere, note that
  bundling it via `@font-face` is a separate portability task.
- **Load the same font files the design composes text from — static faces, not a variable font.**
  A variable font and the family's individual static faces are different files and can carry
  different vertical metrics. Figma picks a concrete named face per weight (Regular, Medium, Bold, …), so if
  the app declares one variable file across a weight range instead, every text run lands on a
  slightly different baseline than the design. The giveaway is that **the error scales with font
  size** — small body text looks fine while headings are visibly off, all in the same direction, so
  it reads as "the text sits too high/low" rather than as a spacing bug. Declare one `@font-face`
  per weight (and per style) pointing at that weight's own file, and keep `font-synthesis: none` so
  a weight you forgot to load fails visibly instead of being faked from a neighbouring one.

  Do not chase this with per-element nudges before checking which font file is loaded: a
  `margin-top` or `line-height` tweak that lines up one heading will be wrong at every other size.
  Verify by measuring the offset at two very different font sizes — if the pixel error grows with
  size, it is the font files, not the CSS. `design-diff explain` reports exactly this gradient
  (see [`figma-measure`](../figma-measure/SKILL.md)).

  Expect a **residual of up to ~1 px on large text even after this**: browsers snap the baseline to
  a whole pixel where Figma places it on a fraction. That last pixel is not worth per-size hacks.

  **Correcting the font files invalidates every nudge that was compensating for them.** On an
  existing screen this rule usually arrives *after* someone already papered over the symptom with a
  `transform: translateY(Npx)`, a pinned `top:` on a baseline-aligned sibling, or a hand-measured
  `line-height` — often with a comment explaining it as an inherent Figma-vs-CSS baseline
  difference. Those compensations were tuned against the *old* metrics, so the moment you swap to
  the right faces they stop cancelling out and start adding: the element that used to be right is
  now off by roughly the nudge. So swapping the font files is not the end of the task — finish by
  grepping the styles for `translateY`, absolute `top:`/`margin-top` offsets, and any
  comment mentioning a measured or baseline correction, then delete each one and re-measure rather
  than re-tuning it. A nudge that is still needed will re-earn itself; most will not.

### Motion the design does not specify

Figma files usually carry end states only, so a transition between them is an addition you author
rather than a value you port — and porting a static design specifies nothing about it. If the task
includes transitions, or a finished screen's animation is reported as rough or stuttering, use the
[`react-transition-performance`](../react-transition-performance/SKILL.md) skill; profile before
changing anything. Nothing else in this skill depends on it.

### Prototype interactions (click-through flows)

The Figma MCP tools describe layout and style, not behavior. `get_metadata`'s node map is
explicitly limited to id/type/name/position/size — a design where frames link to each other via
"on click → navigate" cannot be read from it at all, and it is easy to conclude a flow has no
interactivity just because that tool didn't show any.

- **Detect wiring from `get_design_context` output first.** A node carrying an `ON_CLICK` →
  `NAVIGATE` reaction renders as a clickable `<a>` (with `cursor-pointer`); a visually identical
  sibling with no reaction renders as a plain `<div>`. When a design shows a primary/secondary
  button pair and only one comes back as an `<a>`, that is the file telling you only one is
  actually wired — don't wire both into equivalent handlers just because they look like a pair.
- **Get authoritative wiring from the Figma REST API when you need to confirm it across many
  nodes/screens** — none of the bundled MCP tools expose this field directly. Call
  `GET https://api.figma.com/v1/files/:fileKey/nodes?ids=<nodeId>` (or `/v1/files/:fileKey` for
  the whole file) with header `X-Figma-Token: <token>` (commonly already available as a
  `FIGMA_TOKEN` env var). Each node in the response carries an `interactions` array —
  `trigger.type` (e.g. `ON_CLICK`) and `actions` (e.g.
  `{ type: "NODE", navigation: "NAVIGATE", destinationId: "<nodeId>" }`). Walk the returned tree,
  collect every node with a non-empty `interactions`, and resolve each `destinationId` against
  the same tree's node names to build a click → next-frame map.
- **A frame that never appears as a `destinationId` is orphaned.** Before wiring every frame the
  user points at into a reachable state, check whether its node id shows up as a destination
  anywhere in the pulled interaction data. A frame with no incoming reaction isn't part of the
  click-through flow — flag it instead of silently including it as if it were reachable.
- **Translate the wiring, not just the pixels.** When a Figma flow becomes app state (routes, a
  step machine, a `next`-id field in config, a click handler that advances a `useState`, etc.),
  carry over the same live/dead-end distinction the file encodes: a button with a reaction gets a
  real handler that advances state; a button without one must stay inert, even though it has
  identical button styling to the one next to it. Guessing that a good-looking button "must" do
  something produces a UI that lets users advance down a path the design never actually wired.

### Strokes / borders (do not translate a Figma Stroke to a CSS `border`)

A Figma **Stroke is layout-neutral**: padding is measured from the frame's bounds and the stroke is
painted on that edge, so adding/removing a stroke never moves the frame's children. A CSS **`border`
is part of the box model**: with `box-sizing: border-box` it pushes all content inward by the stroke
width (and shrinks the content area); with `content-box` it grows the frame. Either way a plain
`border` on a fixed-size, padded auto-layout frame **shifts content or resizes the box** versus the
design — most visibly when only one variant (hover, selected, alert) carries the stroke, so its text
drops off the baseline shared by the others.

- Translate a decorative stroke to a **layout-neutral ring**: `box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 <w> <color>`
  or `outline: <w> solid <color>; outline-offset: -<w>` — never a plain `border` — so the content
  position is identical to the un-stroked variant.
- **Respect stroke alignment.** *Inside* → inset ring (stays within the frame footprint; keeps gaps
  between siblings intact). *Outside* → outset ring (`box-shadow: 0 0 0 <w>` / `outline`), but note
  it is painted beyond the frame and **eats into the gap** to adjacent elements — only use it when
  the design's stroke is genuinely outside. *Center* → split the width across an inset+outset pair.
  When alignment is ambiguous, an inside-aligned inset ring is the safe default and matches most
  component states.
- **When a variant differs from its base only by a stroke,** make sure the base reserves the same
  space (e.g. a transparent inset ring / border) so switching states causes zero reflow.

### Text wrapping & line breaks

- **Keep a text layer as one string; let CSS soft-wrap it.** Do not split a label into multiple
  spans joined by synthesized `<br>`s to force the design's line breaks — each span then soft-wraps on
  its own and the result diverges from the source text (and often clips). Port the layer's actual
  string and its white-space mode.
- **Reproduce where the design wraps, which means reproducing the wrap *width*.** A Figma text box
  often hugs its content and is allowed to run into the frame's padding before wrapping, so a line can
  be wider than the padded content box. If you constrain wrapping to `frame − 2×padding`, a long line
  breaks too early (one word too soon). Check where the design actually wraps and give the text that
  width (e.g. `width: calc(100% + <padding>)` to let it use the padding up to the frame edge), rather
  than adding a manual break.
- **Don't clip text horizontally.** An `overflow: hidden` added only to bound height will also cut off
  text that legitimately overflows the padding. Bound height without clipping width.
- **Verify against the widest realistic content, not just the sampled string** — a header/label that
  fits the sampled data can still wrap or clip on a longer value.

## 5. Anti-hallucination constraints

- **No guessing styles.** If a property (`border`, `box-shadow`, `border-radius`…) is not in the
  Figma node data, do not add it to the CSS.
- **Color integrity.** Only use colors defined in Figma variables or existing project tokens. If a
  hex is within ~5% brightness of an existing token, use the token. If there's no close match,
  **ask before proceeding** — never invent a value.
- **Ghost outlines.** Only add `outline`/`border` if it exists as an explicit **Stroke** in Figma.
  Never add borders for visual separation the design doesn't have. And when a Stroke *does* exist,
  render it as a layout-neutral ring, not a `border` — see "Strokes / borders" in section 4.
- **No absolute positioning** unless the Figma layer is explicitly "Absolute position".
- **Zero-margin policy.** All spacing comes from Figma Auto Layout → tokens/px. Don't rely on
  default browser margins/paddings.
- **Truncated data:** never fill gaps with assumptions — use `get_metadata` then re-fetch the real
  node(s).

## 6. Verification

This section is the **flow**; §7 is its companion and holds the substance — what the recurring
mismatches are, and where to escalate one you can't explain by eye. Run these in order:

1. Re-fetch `get_screenshot` and compare it against the rendered code. Before comparing against a
   *committed* export instead (an overlay image, a sync baseline — steps 6 and 7), diff a fresh
   export against it first: a stale reference reads as a code defect. See "Stale baselines" under
   "Verify & deliver".
2. Proofread every string on the screen against the export, and check every element's position and
   fill against it — the whole frame, not the part you were asked about. See "Read the design, don't
   just diff it" under "Verify & deliver": this is the largest class of defect, the cheapest to
   prevent, and no pixel metric will raise it for you. Read before you measure or fix.
3. Fix any layout drift, spacing mismatch, wrong colour, or extra border **before** finishing. If the
   screenshot has a clean background but your CSS added a border, remove it.
4. Work through §7 for the screen you just built — by area (tokens & colour, type, icons, layout),
   then "Verify & deliver". Escalate anything still unexplained to the
   [`figma-measure`](../figma-measure/SKILL.md) skill.
5. Run the app with its own dev command from `package.json` (a `/run` skill, if installed, can launch
   it for you) to confirm visually.
6. If the user opted into `react-pixel-overlay` (section 2), also verify under the overlay with the
   exported design image.
7. If the user opted into `figma-sync` (section 2), re-baseline and confirm the sync status is clean.
8. Lint using the project's own lint command before finishing.

Don't treat step 1 as the whole of verification: a screenshot comparison by eye catches boxes and
colours, and reliably misses the per-element errors §7 exists for.

## 7. Pixel-fidelity checklist (why a "done" screen still reads as "slightly off")

Small per-element errors — a body size off by 4px, weight 400 vs 500, an inverted token, a
missing constraint — compound and read to the user as "everything is slightly off" even when
the layout boxes are correct. Work through these by area.

Bullets tagged **[preflight]** are **source-fixable**: prevent them upstream by running
[`figma-preflight`](../figma-preflight/SKILL.md) before codegen (see §0) rather than compensating
here every regeneration. Untagged bullets are inherent to codegen or delivery — this is where they
get handled.

### Tokens & color

- **[preflight]** **Never trust the fallback literal in `var(--token, fallback)`.** Figma codegen writes
  `var(--text/primary, black)`, but that trailing `black`/`white` is a generic placeholder, NOT
  the variable's value. Resolve every token via `get_variable_defs` and reference the project's
  token — using the fallback silently inverts colors (dark-bg/white-text labels become
  white-bg/black-text; white dots become black).
- **[preflight]** **Don't assume the page background is the `background` token — check the frame's fill.** A
  token named `fills/background` (e.g. #000) does not mean the screen uses it; a design often
  fills the whole screen with a `surface` color and reserves the near-black token for
  insets/pills. Sample the actual frame fill (cheap: crop a ~20px corner, read one pixel).
- **[preflight]** **Preserve the surface-elevation ladder — don't collapse near-identical neutrals.** Keep the
  RELATIVE order (e.g. card lighter than page, tiles/rows lighter than card, inset panels darker
  than card). Shift the whole ladder one step and nested insets that share a token with their
  parent lose all contrast and **vanish** — when a panel looks missing, suspect the parent
  surface token before adding borders/shadows.
- **Color data-driven marks by their value, not one accent** (e.g. gauge/waveform bars that are
  an accent color only past a threshold, dimmed otherwise). Read the per-mark color from assets.
- **[preflight]** **An isolated component render can be in a different theme mode than the screen.** If the
  `get_design_context` preview looks inverted vs. the overview export, trust the full-frame
  export and screen-level token values (ground truth), not the isolated preview.

### Type & fonts

- **[preflight]** **Read exact type per text node — never eyeball it.** Pull `font-size`, `font-weight`,
  `line-height`, letter-spacing, and container padding/gap from `get_design_context`. A value
  outside the design's type ramp (e.g. `24px` when the ramp is 20/26/40/72) is a tell you guessed.
- **[preflight]** **An off-brand `font-['Inter:…']` in the codegen usually means the Figma file is missing that
  weight of the brand font** and substituted a system font for just those layers. This is a
  decision, not an auto-fix: surface it — keep the brand font (correct for production) or bundle
  the fallback to match the mockup 1:1. Don't silently ship a non-brand font or silently "correct" it.
- **Don't inherit type from your own earlier implementation.** Once a shared component exists, the next
  screen's version of it gets rendered by code whose `font-weight` was read from a *different* node. A
  design routinely sets one heading in Bold while its siblings are Medium — re-read the font style the
  codegen reports (`<Family>:Bold` vs `<Family>:Medium`) for the node in front of you rather than
  trusting what the component already does. Weight errors are nearly invisible by eye and barely move
  an aggregate diff; **ink coverage** settles it objectively — see "Weight differences need ink" in
  [`figma-measure`](../figma-measure/SKILL.md).
- **Fix the font before the size.** Different families size differently per px, so matching a
  size by eye with the wrong family gives a compensating value that's wrong once the right font
  loads. Set `font-family` first, then apply the design's real `font-size`.
- **Carry `font-feature-settings`, not just size/weight.** The node may specify figure style
  (`"lnum" 1, "pnum" 1` = proportional lining) vs the `tabular-nums` you'd default to; numbers
  look "off in style" if you ignore it.

### Icons

- **Use the design's real icon assets — never hand-draw `<path>` data from memory.**
  `get_design_context` returns each icon as an asset URL (usually SVG). Tint them by replacing
  `fill="var(--fill-0, …)"` with `fill="currentColor"` and setting the parent's `color`. Inline
  them (e.g. a small `icons.json` + one `Icon` component). Flag any stub as a placeholder.
- **Fetch every icon node individually — same label ≠ same icon.** Sibling tags with identical
  text can use entirely different glyphs; a message's alert icon can differ from a status row's.
  Use the icon the specific node references, not one reused from a sibling.
- **A layer's name can lie about geometry — verify the actual glyph.** A node named "Navigation
  Left" may hold a right-pointing arrow (the design flips it per instance); read the path/render
  and mirror with `scaleX(-1)` as the design does, or arrows come out reversed.

### Layout, spacing & constraints

- **[preflight]** **Carry size constraints, not just padding/color — `min-width`/`min-height`/`max-width`.** A
  button's `min-w-[160px]` keeps a short label a full-width pill; a text block's `max-w-[Npx]`
  sets the wrap point (a body wrapping "too late" is usually a missing `max-width`, not a font bug).
- **[preflight]** **When the codegen's values contradict the node's own geometry, the geometry wins.** §7's colour
  rule says not to trust the *fallback* in `var(--token, fallback)`; this is the stronger case — the
  token value itself can be wrong for the instance you are looking at. Codegen may report
  `px-[11.429px]` for a pill whose node is 204px wide around a 184px label, which leaves 10px a
  side, not 11.4. Sizes and positions from `get_metadata`, and distances measured off the export,
  describe what will actually be rendered; the token names describe what the component was
  *supposed* to inherit. Reconcile the two before coding: when they disagree, implement the measured
  value and say so, because the mismatch is usually an override or a detached instance the designer
  should know about.
- **[preflight]** **Match the design's flex alignment** (`items-end` vs `center`) and let heights be
  content-driven where the design is; a header forced to `align-items: center` + fixed height
  when the design uses `items-end` shifts every title a few px.
- **[preflight]** **`space-between` is not "evenly spaced with fixed pitch."** It stretches repeated marks
  edge-to-edge with a container-dependent pitch that drifts from the design's fixed pitch (a
  difference-overlay shows ghost "doubling"). Reproduce real pitch = mark-width + gap
  (`justify-center` + a set `gap`). Account for `stroke-linecap: round` rendering a line ~2px
  longer than nominal.
- **Don't double-render baked content.** If you bake a region into one image (a map that already
  contains rings/legend/labels), don't also re-render those elements as HTML/CSS on top — they
  mismatch and read as doubled. One source of truth per element; if you can't get a clean asset,
  choose the baked version deliberately and note baked text is no longer config-driven.

### Verify & deliver

**Read the design, don't just diff it.** Measurement finds what you thought to look for. In practice
the largest class of "slightly off" is not layout at all and no metric raises it: a label the design
sets in sentence case and the code sets in title case, a stray space in a composed string, a list row
whose content is simply stale, a mark placed on the wrong side of a figure. Each touches a few
hundred pixels of a multi-megapixel frame, so every screen-level number stays green while a reader
sees the mistake immediately. Before measuring anything, read the export: every string against the
rendered string, every mark and badge against its position in the design. Where the copy lives in a
config/CMS layer rather than the component, proofread that layer — the design is the source for the
words too, not just the boxes. Text you did not personally check against the export is unverified,
however good the diff looks.

**Default fidelity, then escalate.** The cheap pass applies to every element and is all most runs
need: read the exact specs per node (the sections above), do the read pass just described, and
eyeball **one** `difference`-blend overlay of your render on the design export (matching pixels go
black). Escalate to precise measurement only when a specific element is still flagged as off, the
overlay shows drift you can't explain by eye, or the user asks whether *any* member of a class of
elements is wrong. That is what the [`figma-measure`](../figma-measure/SKILL.md) skill is for — which
mechanism to use, how to prove the check can actually see the defect, and how to read the number it
returns. Don't measure to learn the spec: `get_design_context` states it outright.

- **Beyond §3's per-node fetch, don't reconstruct a rich sub-component from the overview
  screenshot.** A media card / carousel / chart has assets and styles you'll fake otherwise — a
  6-thumbnail strip is six *different* images, and image crops are explicit (Figma gives
  size/offset like `h-[152.58%] top-[-6.21%]` → replicate via `object-position`, not center `cover`).
- **When you swap a baked image asset, re-derive its placement — don't inherit the old CSS.** The
  positioning that made the previous asset correct encodes what that particular export *contained*.
  Exporting the **source node** and exporting the **container that clips it** produce different
  images: the container export already has the crop and offset baked in and fills its frame 1:1, while
  a source export still needs the design's `width`/`height`/offset (and `object-fit: fill`) to
  reproduce the same crop. Feeding a container export into source-geometry CSS re-scales it — discs
  become ovals — and the diff gets *worse* than before the swap, which is the tell.
- **Cache-bust when overwriting a hosted asset at the same URL.** In-place replacement keeps
  serving stale bytes to cached clients — server updated, app shows old. Version the filename or
  add `?v=N` and update the reference. Confirm the server serves new bytes AND the app fetches
  the new URL (separate failures).
- **"Looks wrong but your source matches" → suspect stale delivery before re-editing.** Diff the
  deployed asset against the design (byte size / pixel compare); if they match, the bug is
  delivery (cache, unmounted volume, stale dev bundle, wrong env), not the code.
- **Stale baselines: re-export before you trust a number, not after it confuses you.** Committed
  overlay/baseline exports go stale the moment a designer touches the file, and nothing in the repo
  signals it — expect this to be common, and not always cosmetic (a component rebuilt under a *new
  node id*, two cards swapping layout, a typo fixed in Figma but not in your content). A stale
  reference reads as a code defect: you "fix" correct code toward an old design. So diff a fresh
  export against the committed one first; if they differ, re-export from the *new* node at the
  overlay's target resolution and re-run every measurement taken against the old ones. When drift
  tracking exists (`figma-sync` or similar), `DESIGN_CHANGED` is the trigger to re-export — and a
  clean `SYNC` only means "unchanged since the last baseline", never "code matches design".

## Setup note

This skill needs a connected Figma MCP server. If the tools aren't available, the user needs to
authorize a Figma MCP connector first — e.g. via **claude.ai → Settings → Connectors**, or
`claude mcp` / `/mcp` for other setups.
