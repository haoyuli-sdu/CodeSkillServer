# Syncfusion MAUI UI Builder

## Overview

The **Syncfusion MAUI UI Builder** skill is a presentation-layer .NET MAUI component generator that orchestrates an AI agent through 8 stages to generate production-ready UI components powered by Syncfusion MAUI Controls. Supports iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS with unified codebase.

This spec is **Agent Skills Specification compliant** with one-level-deep file references for optimal context loading by AI agents.

## What This Skill Does

**✅ Generates:**
- MAUI views (`.xaml`) with Syncfusion control declarations
- Code-behind files (`.xaml.cs`) with event handlers and logic
- ViewModels (`.cs`) with MVVM pattern and INotifyPropertyChanged
- MAUI ResourceDictionary for colors, styles, and design tokens
- Syncfusion MAUI component integration with correct imports and properties
- Form validation logic with data annotation support
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility markup (semantic control hierarchy, automation IDs)
- Responsive layouts with FlexLayout and Grid (mobile-first, scales to tablet/desktop)
- Multi-platform support (OnPlatform styling for iOS/Android/Windows/macOS)
- Proper C# typing and MVVM command infrastructure

**❌ Does NOT Generate:**
- Backend code (API endpoints, services, middleware)
- Database schemas or Entity Framework models
- Authentication/authorization logic (services responsibility)
- Business logic or data access layer
- Navigation Shell configuration (Shell.xaml routing)
- Platform-specific native code (Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin)
- Environment secrets or infrastructure config

## When to Use

### ✅ USE this Orchestrator Agent for:

- **Full UI builds** with 3+ Syncfusion controls
- **Design system decisions** required (colors, spacing, typography)
- **Complete pages or dashboards** from scratch
- **WCAG 2.1 AA validation** for complex layouts
- **Multi-stage workflows** requiring design → code → validate
- **Team collaboration** on larger component projects
- Examples:
  - Building a complete MAUI admin dashboard
  - Designing a multi-page wizard interface
  - Creating a full data management portal with multiple sections

### ❌ DO NOT USE this Orchestrator for:

- ✋ Configuring a single control (use skill directly)
- ✋ Quick implementation questions (use skill directly)
- ✋ Component tutorials or how-tos (use skill directly)
- ✋ Troubleshooting component issues (use skill + diagnostic protocol)
- ✋ Backend/API code (out of scope)
- ✋ Non-Syncfusion MAUI questions (use general help)

## Supported Components (Syncfusion MAUI)

- **Forms**: Login (SfTextInputLayout, SfCheckBox), registration, password reset, contact forms, multi-step wizards
- **Data Display**: SfDataGrid (sorting, filtering, pagination), SfListView, SfCharts, SfTreeView, SfKanban
- **Input Controls**: SfTextInputLayout, SfMaskedEntry, SfComboBox, SfDatePicker, SfTimePicker, SfCheckBox, SfRadioButton
- **Navigation**: SfTabView, SfNavigationDrawer, SfToolbar, Breadcrumbs (custom)
- **Common Patterns**: SfPopup (modals/dialogs), SfBadgeView (badges), SfChip (tags), SfCarousel (carousels)
- **Page Templates**: Dashboards, e-commerce catalog, checkout flows, portfolios, user profiles, settings pages
- **Indicators & Feedback**: SfBusyIndicator, SfLinearProgressBar, SfCircularProgressBar, SfLinearGauge

```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Active .NET MAUI project** (.NET MAUI 8.0+, multi-platform targets: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS)
2. **.NET 8.0+** or **.NET 9.0+** SDK installed
3. **Visual Studio 2022 (v17.8+)** or **VS Code with C# DevKit**
4. **Syncfusion MAUI components library** (auto-installed during Stage 7):
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Syncfusion.Maui.Core
   dotnet add package Syncfusion.Maui.Inputs
   dotnet add package Syncfusion.Maui.DataGrid
   ```
5. **Syncfusion license key** (Community, Trial, or Commercial) — prompted in Stage 2
   - Get free Community License: https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials

### Basic Usage

**Example 1: Generate a Login Page**

```
User: "Create a login page with email, password, and remember me checkbox for my MAUI app"

Skill executes:
  → Stage 1: Identifies login form component type
  → Stage 2: Detects MAUI project structure, .NET version, target platforms
  → Stage 3: Maps layout fields to Syncfusion MAUI controls (SfTextInputLayout, SfCheckBox, SfButton)
  → Stage 4: Locks design system (Material theme, MAUI ResourceDictionary, responsive layout)
  → Stage 5: Generates LoginPage.xaml + LoginPage.xaml.cs + LoginPageViewModel.cs with MVVM
  → Stage 6: Validates WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility + Syncfusion integration
  → Stage 7: Detects and installs Syncfusion NuGet packages
  → Stage 8: Inserts code into MAUI project, updates namespaces

Output:
  ✓ Views/LoginPage.xaml (XAML view with Syncfusion controls)
  ✓ Views/LoginPage.xaml.cs (Code-behind with bindings)
  ✓ ViewModels/LoginPageViewModel.cs (MVVM ViewModel with INotifyPropertyChanged)
  ✓ Works on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS with platform-specific styling
```

**Example 2: Generate a Customer Data Grid**

```
User: "Build a customer data table with sorting, filtering, and pagination"

Output:
  ✓ Views/CustomerDataGridPage.xaml (SfDataGrid control with columns)
  ✓ Views/CustomerDataGridPage.xaml.cs (Event handlers)
  ✓ ViewModels/CustomerDataGridViewModel.cs (ObservableCollection with mock data)
  ✓ OnPlatform styling for iOS/Android/Windows
  ✓ Responsive layout adapts to screen sizes
  ✓ WCAG 2.1 AA keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance
```

## How It Works: 8-Stage AI Orchestration (Stateless)

The skill orchestrates **8 stages of pure AI reasoning** with **two user decision points**.

**Key Architecture:**
- **Stateless design**: Conversation history maintains state across stages
- **Pure AI reasoning**: Each stage reads guidance docs, analyzes context, makes MAUI-informed decisions
- **2 user decision gates**: Stage 3 (Syncfusion component confirmation) + Stage 6 (validation result)
- **5 fully automated stages**: 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7-8
- **Dedicated theming stage**: Stage 4 locks MAUI design system (ResourceDictionary, theme, colors, spacing) before code generation
- **Multi-platform support**: All generated code targets iOS, Android, Windows, macOS with OnPlatform adaptation

### Boundary Rules (CRITICAL)

**AI agents executing this skill MUST:**

1. **Presentation layer only**: Never generate backend code (API services, database schemas, business logic)
2. **MAUI Views & ViewModels only**: Generate `.xaml`, `.xaml.cs`, and `ViewModel.cs` files in Views/ and ViewModels/ directories
3. **Mock data only**: Use `ObservableCollection` with hardcoded samples; no direct HTTP calls to real APIs
4. **No platform-specific native code**: Use XAML/C# only; don't generate Objective-C, Swift, Java, or Kotlin
5. **No Shell/Navigation setup**: Don't generate Shell.xaml routing; user configures navigation separately
6. **Control selection integrity**: 
   - ✅ Prefer Syncfusion MAUI controls first (SfTextInputLayout, SfDataGrid, SfButton, SfCheckBox, etc.)
   - ✅ If required control is NOT available in Syncfusion, fall back to native MAUI framework controls (Button, Entry, Label, Picker, etc.)
   - ❌ **DO NOT use incorrect or incompatible Syncfusion controls** — verify control exists and supports the use case
   - ❌ **DO NOT add non-existent Syncfusion skills** — consult skill documentation for available controls
7. **Multi-platform required**: All generated code must target iOS, Android, Windows, macOS (use OnPlatform where needed)
8. **File handling libraries out of scope (but can be referenced from UI)**: Word, PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, PDFToImage, Markdown, SmartDataExtraction, Calculate are backend/document processing services — NOT UI components. These must be handled by backend services or separate backend skills. However, UI forms CAN trigger or reference these services for certain needed actions (e.g., export to PDF button, import Excel data button, generate Word document). The services themselves are not generated by this skill — only UI buttons/actions that call them.
9. **Redirect backend/API requests**: *"This skill generates MAUI UI only. Service integration is your app's responsibility. Ready to generate the view with mock data?"*

### Error Handling

If any stage fails:

1. **Retry once** with same approach
2. **If retry fails**, attempt workaround or skip to next stage
3. **Notify user** with error message from stage output
4. **Offer recovery**: *"Would you like to go back to Stage 3 and choose a different layout?"*
5. **Reference**: `references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for common errors

### Resource Loading Strategy (Progressive Disclosure)

**Load SKILL.md first** (you're reading it now) ~500 lines for MAUI

**Load stage guides on-demand** (each ~150-250 lines):
- `stage-1-intent-analysis.md` → During Stage 1
- `stage-2-project-detection.md` → During Stage 2 (MAUI .NET version, platform detection)
- `stage-3-layout-analysis.md` → During Stage 3 (Syncfusion component mapping)
- `stage-4-theming-and-design-system.md` → During Stage 4 (ResourceDictionary, OnPlatform)
- `stage-5-code-generation.md` → During Stage 5 (XAML, C#, MVVM generation)
- `stage-6-validation.md` → During Stage 6 (validation checklist)
- `stage-7-dependencies.md` → During Stage 7 (NuGet packages)
- `stage-8-code-insertion.md` → During Stage 8 (file insertion, build verification)

**Load support references only when needed**:
- `LAYOUT-DESIGN.md` → For MAUI-specific design patterns and accessibility
- `MAUI-DOTNET-STANDARDS.md` → When validating or checking best practices
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` → When errors occur
- `assets/validation-rules.md` → When validating in Stage 6

**Result**: Initial load ~500 lines (SKILL.md only). Full spec available on-demand, never exceeding Agent Skills context limits.

## Configuration & User Customization

### Auto-Detected Settings

During **Stage 2 (Project Detection)**, AI automatically detects:

- **.NET Version**: .NET 8.0, .NET 9.0+
- **MAUI Target Platforms**: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS (from .csproj TargetFrameworks)
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM (default) or code-behind
- **Styling Strategy**: MAUI ResourceDictionary (default) or XAML Styles
- **Project Structure**: Views/, ViewModels/, Resources/ directory locations
- **Formatting**: C# conventions (indentation, naming, braces)
- **Syncfusion License Status**: Registered or trial/community

### User Override Options

In **Stage 2**, user can override any detected setting:

```
Detected Settings:
  .NET Version: 9.0
  Target Platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
  Architecture: MVVM
  Styling: ResourceDictionary
  Syncfusion License: Community (valid)

[Confirm] [Override Each] [Cancel]
```

### Syncfusion License Configuration

The skill handles Syncfusion license key setup:

1. **Check** for existing license in MauiProgram.cs or environment
2. **If missing**, prompt user: *"Get a free Community License at https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials"*
3. **If provided**, inject `Syncfusion.Licensing.SyncfusionLicenseProvider.RegisterLicense(licenseKey)` in MauiProgram.cs
4. **If skipped**, proceed but warn that Syncfusion controls will show license watermark in debug/release

## Code Generation Standards

All generated code includes:

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Semantic MAUI control hierarchy (semantic controls for roles)
- ✅ Automation IDs for all interactive elements
- ✅ Accessible labels and descriptions (SemanticProperties)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (TabIndex, focus order management)
- ✅ Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (verified via MAUI Color resources)
- ✅ Touch-friendly targets (44x44 points minimum per MAUI guidance)
- ✅ Reduced motion support (respects device accessibility settings)

### Responsive Design (Multi-Platform)
- ✅ Mobile-first layout (320pt base, scales to tablet/desktop)
- ✅ FlexLayout or Grid (no fixed widths, adaptable to screen size)
- ✅ OnPlatform styling (platform-specific adjustments for iOS/Android/Windows/macOS)
- ✅ Safe area handling (iOS notches, Android cutouts via MAUI Margins)
- ✅ Breakpoints for mobile (320-480pt), tablet (480-1024pt), desktop (1024pt+)

### Security
- ✅ Input validation with data annotations
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- ✅ Proper null handling and exception management
- ✅ No direct SQL or unvalidated data access
- ✅ Secure Syncfusion license key management (not exposed in XAML)

### Performance (MAUI Optimized)
- ✅ INotifyPropertyChanged for efficient data binding
- ✅ ObservableCollection for efficient list updates
- ✅ UI virtualization for large lists (if applicable)
- ✅ Lazy loading for images and heavy components
- ✅ Appropriate use of async/await for background tasks

### C# & MAUI Best Practices
- ✅ Full type safety (no `dynamic` or untyped objects)
- ✅ MVVM pattern with ViewModel and ICommand
- ✅ Proper XAML namespaces for Syncfusion controls
- ✅ XML documentation comments on public members
- ✅ C# 11+ modern language features (nullable reference types, records where appropriate)

## Supported Use Cases (Syncfusion MAUI)

- **Login page**: SfTextInputLayout (email, password), SfCheckBox (remember me), SfButton (submit) + validation
- **Customer data grid**: SfDataGrid with sorting, filtering, pagination, row selection, multi-select
- **Dashboard**: Multiple Syncfusion components (SfTabView for tabs, SfDataGrid for data, SfCharts for visualizations)
- **Registration wizard**: Multi-step form with SfSegmentedControl (steps), validation per step, SfButton (next/submit)
- **Settings page**: SfSwitch (toggles), SfComboBox (dropdowns), SfTextInputLayout (text fields), SfDatePicker (date selection)
- **E-commerce catalog**: SfCarousel (product showcase), SfDataGrid or SfListView (product list), SfRating (reviews)
- **Employee list**: SfListView with pull-to-refresh, SfSearchBar, individual detail views with SfDataForm

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Project type not detected" | Ensure `.csproj` file exists with MAUI TargetFrameworks |
| "No .NET 8+ SDK found" | Install .NET 8.0 or 9.0+ from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download |
| "Syncfusion controls show watermark" | Register valid Community/Trial/Commercial license via Stage 2 |
| "Build fails after file insertion" | Check namespace conflicts; verify Syncfusion NuGet versions match |
| "View not rendering on iOS/Android" | Verify OnPlatform styling is correct; check platform-specific control availability |
| "Compilation error: 'SfXXX' not found" | Ensure correct `xmlns:syncfusion="clr-namespace:Syncfusion.Maui.XYZ"` namespace in XAML |
| "WCAG validation fails" | Check automation IDs, semantic control hierarchy, color contrast ratios |
